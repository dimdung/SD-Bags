need to assign the following SG to the ec2 instance:

sg-80ebe4f8	SG-BSP-SoftNas-1.0-T-NFS-Accessor



Also need "nfs-utils" installed and "portmap" (in the case of RHEL5) for RHEL6 "nfs-utils" and "rpcbind"

yum install portmap
yum install nfs-utils

chkconfig portmap on
chkconfig nfs on
chkconfig nfslock on
service portmap start
service nfs start
service nfslock start

Update /etc/fstab

mount -a -t nfs

OR mount -a -t nfs4



There was also an issue how the nfs share was exported, fixed now.
It's easier just to update "/etc/exports" on SoftNAS from ssh and then run "exportfs -a" than to create a share from the Web UI

To view current exports, "exportfs -v"




I fixed the one machine, please let me know if you have problems with any of the others


Thanks,
Samal
