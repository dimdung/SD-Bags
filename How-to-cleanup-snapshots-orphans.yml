snapshots , orphans
I found the solution in http://www.robertsindall.co.uk/blog/how-to-clean-up-amazon-ebs-volumes-and-snapshots/ 

for s in $(comm -23 <(echo $(ec2-describe-snapshots --region eu-west-1 | grep SNAPSHOT | awk '{print $2}' | sort | uniq) | tr ' ' '\n') <(echo $(ec2-describe-images --region eu-west-1 | grep BLOCKDEVICEMAPPING | awk '{print $3}' | sort | uniq) | tr ' ' '\n') | tr '\n' ' ')
do
echo Deleting snapshot $s
ec2-delete-snapshot --region eu-west-1 $s 
done

Tks
